# Overview

Quantum is a collaborative procedure management application used by ground operators during test/flight operations for launch vehicles or satellites. Procedures are groups of tasks to be executed for implementing a missionâ€™s operation by multiple operators with different assigned roles. Quantum includes a library of available procedures, live execution, and an "as-run" archive. It was originally developed by Silicon Valley based startup called Audacy which shut down in 2019.

Quantum includes a modular front-end (allowing users to use and upload their procedures), and a REST API based backend (allowing users to drive displays from their specific data source). The user interface is browser based, using the MEAN technology stack, incorporating rapid maintenance and upgradability while operating in a mission critical environment. 

## Purpose
QUantum is intended as a minimalist / turn-key solution for test and flight operations procedure management. While orginally developed for spaceflight operations, it should be equally suitable to any other activity where multiple & geographically dispered people need to execute any real-time activity in a structured, repeatable, and auditable manner.
