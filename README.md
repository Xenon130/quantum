# Overview

Quantum is a collaborative procedure management application used by ground operators during test/flight for launch vehicles or satellites. Procedures are sequences of tasks to be executed for implementing a mission by multiple operators with different assigned roles. Quantum includes a library of available procedures, live execution, and an "as-run" archive. It was originally developed by a Silicon Valley based startup called Audacy which shut down in 2019.

Quantum consists of a modular front-end (UI), and a REST API backend. The application is browser based using the MEAN technology stack (Mongo db, Exrepss, Angular, NodeJS) with the aim of incorporating rapid maintenance and upgradability while operating in a mission critical environment.

## Purpose
Quantum is intended as a minimalist turn-key solution for test and flight operations procedure management. While orginally developed for spaceflight operations, it should be equally suitable to any other activity where multiple & geographically dispered people need to execute a real-time activity in a structured, repeatable, and auditable manner.
